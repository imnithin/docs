# AntiCheats
Anticheats are an integral part of any public server and help with catching hackers. This page consists of a list of anticheats and some other notes.

Before we begin, since Minecraft's built-in anticheat is practically useless, it's better to turn it off than to endure the constant false positives it spews out. In `server.properties`,
set `allow-flight=true`. In `spigot.yml`, set the following:
```yml
     moved-wrongly-threshold: 100000.0
     moved-too-quickly-multiplier: 100000.0
```
> [!NOTE]
> The `spigot.yml` settings are not necessary if `allow-flight` is true.
